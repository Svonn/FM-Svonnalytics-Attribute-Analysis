# Football Manager 2024 Svonnalytics Attribute Analysis

## What is this about?
In the recent iterations of Football Manager, there has been much discussion about the quality of newgens, especially about the crossing stat of wingbacks.
I was not able to find anyone who did a thorough analysis on this issue, as most posts about this issue only scraped the surface.
This is why I've ran a test save with >100k players in the DB and created a Dash-based dashboard to analyse the data.
